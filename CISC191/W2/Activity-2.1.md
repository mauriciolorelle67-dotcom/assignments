With the actual code, I was a little confused between the method/constructor parameters (newSearch, newValue) with the fields (search, value) inside the class.
However, I made a clear distinction between the two in my code by using `this.search` and `this.value` in order to tell Java that I'm referring to the class' field and not the local parameter.
